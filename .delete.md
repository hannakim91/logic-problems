# Problem - Palindromic Numbers
![Palindrome](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMYqyIPJtjnjiHm/giphy.gif)

The number 47 has an interesting characteristic.

If you take the number, plus its reverse (47 => 74) and then add them together to a number (47+74=121) the resulting sum is a palindrome

Starting at 0, find the first 25 numbers that have this same characteristic as 47, but limit it to where the palindrome is greater than 1000.

Collect the results in an array. Be sure that you're collecting the interesting numbers like 47, not the palindromic sums.

Bonus points if you can do this without converting numbers to strings/arrays.

## Rewrite the question in your own words:

Multiple solutions possible - easier route might be to convert numbers to different datatype like string or arrays, but possible without that

A palindromic number is a number that when added to its reverse creates a palindromic sum (47+74 = **121**)
Find the smallest 25 numbers that have this quality like the number **47**.
The numbers added must be positive (greater than 0)
The sums must be greater than 1000 (4 digits long) 

## What assumptions will you make about this problem if you cannot ask any more clarifying questions? What are your reasons for making those assumptions?
- Need a minimum of two digits to be able to reverse
- Positive numbers only (greater than 0)
- Whole numbers
- Sum must be at least 4 digits long - smallest palindrome is 1001 but that # is not necessarily created by palindromic #s
- 506+605 = 1111 (might be other numbers possible)

## What are your initial thoughts about this problem? (high level design, 2-3 sentences)

Need a function that is able to take numbers starting at 0 (identify each digit,) and return the reverse
Next add the two numbers to return a sum
Then check if the sum is same read forwards and backwards AND at least 4 digits long
  If it is, store the number in an array

## Which data structure(s) do you think you'll use? What pros/cons do you see with that choice?

The more obvious way to solve this is  according to the prompt is by converting the numbers to string or array - would allow string/array methods like `.split()`, checking `.length()` can use `.reverse()` - that might be less performant with all the looping but might give me some ideas on how to solve it better afterwards

Try to store data in objects where possible to reduce run time in exchange for more space use; break down complex functions into simpler ones?


converting data types is not effective
## Write out a few lines of initial pseudocode: (mid-level design, NOT REAL CODE)
Define an empty array, `palindromicNumbers`
Start with `for`/`forEach` loop with initial value 109, increment by 1, stop when `palindromicNumbers.length` is 25
  // 109 because that's the first one when reversed that's > 1000 (though not a palindrome)
  convert each number to a string or array - whatever's easier to reverse? and parseInt it back into a # to add to initial number
  convert sum into 

  ----
  convert each number into string
  split string into array
  store each digit in a number in an object
