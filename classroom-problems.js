// Based on a series of stock prices I've saved from yesterday, write some code that could tell me the best profit possible if I had bought and sold stock during the day.
// For example: 
// given the stock prices below, the function should
// return 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11, making a $6 profit)
// stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
// Returns 6
